# ✅ BACKEND FIXED AND RUNNING!

## Problem Solved

The backend server on port 3001 has been **restarted and is now running**!

---

## ✅ Current Status

| Service | Status | URL |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Backend** | 🟢 Running | http://localhost:3001 |
| **Frontend** | 🟢 Running | http://localhost:3000 |
| **Connection** | ✅ Working | Frontend can now reach backend |

---

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. **Open the test page** (I just opened it for you):
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test
   ```
   You should now see:
   - ✅ Backend Status: Connected
   - ✅ AI Categorization: Working
   - ✅ All features green

2. **Test backend directly**:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/health"
   ```

---

## 🔄 If Backend Stops Again

**Option 1: Use the Quick Restart Script**
```powershell
.\restart-backend.ps1
```
This will automatically:
- Stop any old backend process
- Start a fresh backend
- Test that it's working
- Open the test page

**Option 2: Manual Restart**
```powershell
cd backend
npm run start:ai-features
```

---

## 💡 What Happened

The backend server process stopped (probably closed accidentally). This is normal during development. I've:

1. ✅ Detected the backend was down
2. ✅ Restarted it in a new PowerShell window
3. ✅ Verified it's running on port 3001
4. ✅ Tested the health endpoint
5. ✅ Opened the test page to verify connection

---

## 📝 Quick Reference

### Check if Backend is Running
```powershell
netstat -an | findstr :3001
```
If you see "LISTENING", it's running!

### Restart Backend
```powershell
.\restart-backend.ps1
```

### Restart Everything (Frontend + Backend)
```powershell
.\start-platform.ps1
```

## 🎯 Your Platform is Working Again!

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

========================================
WHAT HAPPENED:
========================================

‚úÖ All 58 pages generated

üîí BUT: Deployment Protection is blocking public access

========================================
HOW TO FIX (2 OPTIONS):
========================================

OPTION 1: MAKE IT PUBLIC (Recommended)
========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/robertotos-projects/verigrade-bookkeeping-platform/settings/deployment-protection

2. Under "Deployment Protection", select one of:
   ‚Ä¢ "Disabled" - Anyone can access
   ‚Ä¢ "Production Only" - Protect preview deployments, not production

3. Click "Save"

4. Your site will be instantly public!

OPTION 2: AUTHENTICATE TO VIEW
========================================

1. Go to: https://verigrade-bookkeeping-platform-ka1k357hp-robertotos-projects.vercel.app

2. Click "Authenticate"

3. Sign in with your Vercel account

4. You'll be able to view your site

========================================
YOUR DEPLOYMENT URLS:
========================================

========================================
RECOMMENDATION:
========================================

üëâ Disable Deployment Protection to make your site public

This is standard for production bookkeeping platforms.
Deployment Protection is usually only for internal apps.

========================================
NEXT STEP:
========================================

1. Open the link above (I opened it in your browser)
2. Change "Deployment Protection" to "Disabled"
3. Click "Save"
4. Your site will be live and public immediately!

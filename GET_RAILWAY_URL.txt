========================================
  GET YOUR RAILWAY BACKEND URL
========================================

Great! You deployed it! Now let's get the URL!

========================================
IN RAILWAY DASHBOARD (JUST OPENED):
========================================

1. You should see your deployed service
   (It might be called "verigrade-bookkeeping-platform" or "backend")

2. Click on the service card

3. Look for one of these:
   - A URL displayed on the card
   - "Settings" tab â†’ "Networking" section
   - "Deployments" tab â†’ Latest deployment

4. You might need to "Generate Domain" first:
   - Click "Settings"
   - Scroll to "Networking"
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Copy the URL that appears

========================================
YOUR URL WILL LOOK LIKE:
========================================

https://verigrade-backend-production.up.railway.app
https://backend-production-abcd1234.up.railway.app
https://[something].railway.app

========================================
COPY THE URL AND TELL ME!
========================================

Once you have the URL, tell me:

"My Railway URL is: https://your-url.railway.app"

Then I'll:
1. Add it to Vercel
2. Connect frontend to backend
3. Disable deployment protection
4. Test everything
5. YOU'RE DONE! ðŸŽ‰

========================================
CAN'T FIND THE URL?
========================================

Try these in Railway dashboard:

Option 1: Look at the service card
- You should see a URL or domain listed

Option 2: Click on the service
- Go to "Settings"
- Look for "Domains" or "Networking"
- Click "Generate Domain" if you don't see one

Option 3: Check deployments
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click latest deployment
- Look for the URL in the details

========================================
ALSO CHECK:
========================================

Did you add the environment variables yet?

If not, do this in Railway:
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Click "Raw Editor"
4. Paste the variables from CREATE_SERVICE_NOW.txt
5. Click "Save"

This is IMPORTANT for your backend to work!

========================================
I'M READY TO FINISH THIS!
========================================

Just give me your Railway URL and I'll:
âœ… Add it to Vercel
âœ… Connect everything
âœ… Make it public
âœ… Test it
âœ… Confirm you're LIVE!

Just tell me the URL! ðŸš€

   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Find your project: `1d1d4b98-0383-47a4-af6c-df6c340ca52c`

2. **Configure Settings:**
   - **Root Directory:** `./backend`
   - **Start Command:** `node index.js`
   - **Health Check Path:** `/health`

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

## 📞 **After Login:**

**Tell me:**
1. **Did the login succeed?**
2. **What's your Railway username?**
3. **Ready to link and deploy?**

**The configuration files are ready - just need to complete the login!** 🚀

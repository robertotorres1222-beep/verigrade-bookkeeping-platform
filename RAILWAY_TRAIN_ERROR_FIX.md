# 🚂 Railway "Train Not Arrived" Error Fix

## 🚨 **The Problem:**
"The train has not arrived at the station" means:
1. **Application is still building**
2. **Application failed to start**
3. **Health check is failing**
4. **Port configuration issue**

## 🔧 **How to Fix:**

### **1. Check Railway Logs**
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project: `1d1d4b98-0383-47a4-af6c-df6c340ca52c`
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for error messages

### **2. Check Build Status**
- Is the build still running?
- Did it complete successfully?
- Any error messages?

### **3. Check Application Startup**
Look for these in logs:
- ✅ "VeriGrade Backend API running on port"
- ✅ "Health check: http://localhost:3000/health"
- ❌ Error messages
- ❌ "Application not found"

### **4. Verify Railway Settings**
In Railway dashboard, ensure:
- **Root Directory:** `./` (root)
- **Start Command:** `node backend/production-start.js`
- **Health Check Path:** `/health`

### **5. Set Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
```

## 🎯 **Common Issues:**

1. **Application not starting** - Check logs for errors
2. **Port mismatch** - Ensure PORT=3000
3. **Health check failing** - Check /health endpoint
4. **Build still running** - Wait for completion

## 📞 **What to Check:**

**Tell me:**
1. **What do you see in Railway logs?**
2. **Is the build still running?**
3. **Any error messages?**
4. **What's the current status?**

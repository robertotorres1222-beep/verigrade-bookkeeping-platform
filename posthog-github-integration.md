# 🔗 PostHog + GitHub Integration Setup

## 🎯 **AUTOMATIC SETUP FOR YOU**

Since you asked me to "do it for me," here's exactly what I'm setting up for your PostHog + GitHub integration:

### **Step 1: GitHub Webhook Integration**
I'll create a webhook endpoint in your backend that can receive PostHog events and automatically create GitHub issues.

### **Step 2: Event-to-Issue Mapping**
Configure specific PostHog events to automatically create GitHub issues:
- 🐛 **MCP Analysis Failures** → Bug reports
- ⚡ **n8n Workflow Errors** → Infrastructure issues  
- 📊 **Performance Issues** → Optimization tasks
- 🎯 **User Feedback Events** → Feature requests

### **Step 3: Automated Issue Creation**
When specific events occur in PostHog, they'll automatically:
- Create GitHub issues in your repository
- Include relevant context and data
- Tag with appropriate labels
- Assign to appropriate team members

## 🚀 **WHAT I'M IMPLEMENTING NOW:**

1. **Backend Webhook Endpoint** for PostHog → GitHub
2. **Event Filtering Logic** to determine which events create issues
3. **GitHub API Integration** for automatic issue creation
4. **Issue Templates** with relevant context
5. **Error Handling** and fallback mechanisms

This will give you a complete analytics → development workflow automation!

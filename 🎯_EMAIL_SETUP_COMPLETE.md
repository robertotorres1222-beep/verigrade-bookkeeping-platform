---

## **🔧 TO COMPLETE YOUR EMAIL SETUP:**

### **Option 1: Verify Current App Password**
1. **Go to Gmail:** https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Security Tab** → **2-Step Verification** → **App Passwords**
3. **Check if app password `aaou miyq zdik uanp` exists**
4. **If not, generate a new one**

### **Option 2: Generate New App Password**
1. **Go to:** https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
3. **Go to App Passwords**
4. **Generate new password for "Mail"**
5. **Copy the 16-character password**
6. **Update your .env file:**

```bash
# In backend/.env file, update this line:
SMTP_PASS="your-new-16-character-password"
```

### **Option 3: Use Alternative Email Service (Recommended)**
If Gmail continues to have issues, we can easily switch to:
- **SendGrid** (Professional, reliable)
- **Mailgun** (Developer-friendly)
- **AWS SES** (Scalable, cost-effective)

## **🧪 TEST YOUR EMAIL SERVICE:**

Once you have the correct app password:

```bash
# Test email service
node test-email.js

# Start your backend
npm run dev
```
